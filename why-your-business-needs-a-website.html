    <h2>Why Your Business Needs a Website</h2>
    <p><em>Posted by Nestle Sites • May 2025</em></p>

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>Let’s keep it real — in 2025, if your business doesn’t have a website, you’re losing clients without even realizing it.</p>

      <h3>1. People Don’t Trust What They Can’t Find</h3>
      <p>Most customers will Google your business before they ever call you or WhatsApp you. If nothing comes up except an Instagram page or an old Facebook profile… they’ll move on to someone who looks more legit. A website builds instant trust.</p>

      <h3>2. You’re Always Open — Even When You’re Offline</h3>
      <p>A website works for you 24/7. Whether you're sleeping, busy with a client, or out of data, your website can still explain your services, show off your work, and make people want to hire you.</p>

      <h3>3. You Stand Out From the Noise</h3>
      <p>Social media is crowded and noisy. A clean website helps you stand out. It makes people say: “Okay, this person is serious.” It also lets you control the full experience — no distractions, no algorithms.</p>

      <h3>4. You Look Bigger Than You Are</h3>
      <p>You don’t have to be a big company to look professional. A good website makes you look like you’ve got your business handled — even if it’s just you for now.</p>

      <h3>5. You Save Time</h3>
      <p>Instead of repeating your prices, your work hours, or how to book you, your site answers those questions once — and forever.</p>
