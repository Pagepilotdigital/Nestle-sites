    <h2>How to Improve Your Site's SEO</h2>
    <p><em>Posted by Nestle Sites • May 2025</em></p>

    <div class="blog-content">
      <p>SEO sounds complicated — but it’s really just a fancy way of asking: <strong>“Can people find your business online?”</strong></p>

      <h3>1. Use the Right Words on Your Site</h3>
      <p>If you’re a makeup artist in Pretoria, those exact words should be on your homepage. Don’t just say “I do face beats.” Google doesn’t know what that means — your future clients don’t either.</p>

      <h3>2. Make Sure Every Page Has a Title and Description</h3>
      <p>Each page on your website should have a proper title and meta description. This is what shows up on Google — not just “Home” or “Untitled Page.”</p>

      <h3>3. Connect Your Site to Google Search Console</h3>
      <p>This tool is free, and it shows if your site is being indexed (and how it's performing). If we built your site, we can help you set this up in minutes.</p>

      <h3>4. Add Your Location</h3>
      <p>Don’t just say you’re open “anywhere.” If you’re in Nkomazi or Cape Town — say that. It helps local clients find you.</p>

      <h3>5. Keep Your Site Fast and Mobile-Friendly</h3>
      <p>Google prioritizes fast websites that work well on phones. Lucky for you — that’s Nestle Sites’ specialty.</p>
